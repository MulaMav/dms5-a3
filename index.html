                    <h2>8. What did you find annoying and/or boring about interacting with it?</h2>
                    <p>I feel that Orb.Farm provides enough elements for me to interact with; however, visually, there is room for improvement. The algae and grass look quite similar, and I often anticipate new reactions and visual changes during gameplay. I wonder if the microorganisms in the water could generate corals with various colors and shapes. These aspects are what keep me on the game, for a bit longer time.</p>
