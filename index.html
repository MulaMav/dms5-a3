                    <h2>1.Your desired outcome for the project - what did you want it to do?</h2>
                    <p>For this web tool, my idea is to create an immediately usable, portable photo‐editing site that also offers some experimental filter functions, or lets users generate flat assets like differently colored noise and material texture simulations. I want all the controls lined up at the bottom so that by accidentally dragging different sliders in various combinations, you can achieve unique effects. I’m also researching stacking effects of different types of noise, so I created various noise options for users to experiment with.</p>

                    <h2>2. What values, besides novelty, were important for the project?</h2>
                    <p>Randomness, immediacy, and simple controls. Strive to make every step as straightforward and clear as possible, rather than continuously adding new animations or elements.

                    <h2>3. What were the limitations (conceptual and/or technical) you placed on the project's design space?</h2>
                    <p>There aren’t many experimental features, SVG filters are quite limited, but all the filters are fairly simple and mostly represent common effects. As for the interface, if there’s time it could use better UI design, with clearer communication of features and a more effective layout for indicating functionality.</p>

                    <h2>4. What were your choices and intentions in relation to the style/character/aesthetics of the project?</h2>
                    <p>This site is meant to be minimalist, with no overly complex stylized elements, because I want users to focus on editing their images and have a clearer set of controls. Last year my site was criticized for being too complicated, so this year I want to keep it simpler.</p>

                    <h2>5. What choices did you make about the technical implementation of the project?</h2>
                    <p>This is bascially just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript without relying on many other APIs or libraries. I originally wanted to add some Tone.js synthesizer sounds, but I felt it wasn’t really necessary for a filter website like this. I also didn’t use Konva because all the functionality is built with SVG filters. However, after many tests, the exported image results weren’t ideal: when applying noise, the image’s original size would change, and the exported version wasn’t sharp enough. So I tried another library, and once I saw it worked, I stopped making changes—afraid that tweaking it further might break things. My code is indeed quite messy, and I hope to address these basic issues in the future.</p>

                    <h2>6.How did you balance the project as a gestalt whole?</h2>
                    <p>All the filter functions are straightforward and clear, making them very easy to use. I avoid stacking too many effects so that rendering stays simple and everything runs smoothly—no waiting or lag. During testing, some features were quite laggy, so I didn’t include them. The visual focus remains squarely on the image adjustment area.
